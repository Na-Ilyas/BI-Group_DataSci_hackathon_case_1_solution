# BI-Group_DataSci_hackathon_case_1_solution
This is a catboost classifier solution.
The features were selected rigorously through different Machine Learning techniques you can see in the notebook.
Catboost was utilized due to the fact that it works better with categorical features than other boosters such as LightGBM or Xgboost.
The hyperparameters were tuned, however, there might be solution that can be slightly better, there was no time and compute to implement optuna for this catboost. Yet, this is the best solution on both public and private datasets.
Unfortunately, the dataset is closed and cannot be distributed since I signed NDA. However, if you have any other ideas to get better results or other parameters feel free to contact me: ilyas.nagiyev@nu.edu.kz
